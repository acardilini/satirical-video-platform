Its core purpose is to simplify a complex, multi-stage creative process by providing a unified environment where various expert roles can contribute seamlessly. The platform's primary value proposition lies in its ability to centralise the creative workflow, enable efficient hand-offs between specialised personas, and ensure that the final AI-generated video outputs precisely align with the initial satirical vision.  
Key features of the SVPP will encompass comprehensive project management capabilities, intuitive content collaboration tools, mechanisms for structured input and output generation, and sophisticated AI prompt optimisation. The overarching objective is to empower creative teams to efficiently produce high-quality, impactful satirical video content, transforming raw news articles into compelling, satirically incisive visual narratives. This platform will bridge the gap between creative conceptualisation and technical execution, particularly for teams without extensive coding experience, by providing a structured pathway for LLM-assisted development.

## **2\. User Experience (UX) & User Flows**

This section delineates the target users of the SVPP, their distinct roles within the satirical video production pipeline, and their anticipated interactions with the platform to achieve their respective objectives. A thorough understanding of these personas and their journeys is paramount for designing an intuitive, efficient, and user-centric application that supports a collaborative workflow.

### **2.1 Target User Personas**

The SVPP will cater to a specific set of expert personas, each contributing unique skills and outputs to the video production pipeline. Each persona's interaction with the platform is tailored to their specialised function, ensuring optimal workflow efficiency and output quality.

* **The Project Director**: This individual serves as the primary user, overseeing the entire video production process. Their responsibilities include providing initial concepts and news articles, offering critical feedback, and approving outputs at various stages of development.\[1, 1, 1, 1, 1\] For this role, the platform must offer a clear overview of project progress and the ability to easily review and comment on work submitted by all other personas. The Project Director acts as the central orchestrator, necessitating robust project management features such as intuitive dashboards, a comprehensive notification system, and streamlined approval workflows. The user interface and user experience for this role must therefore prioritise clarity and control over detailed content creation tools, allowing for effective guidance of the project from its conceptualisation to final completion.  
* **The Creative Strategist**: Operating at the very beginning of the workflow, this persona focuses on deconstructing news stories to identify core satirical opportunities. Their expertise lies in brainstorming, critiquing ideas, and providing a clear creative direction for the satirical video. The primary output of this role is a set of "Director's Notes," which serve as the foundational creative brief for the entire video production workflow. The platform must provide dedicated tools for collaborative ideation, structured input fields for their notes, and a clear hand-off mechanism to subsequent stages. The foundational nature of the "Director's Notes" necessitates a dedicated project initiation module within the platform. This module should facilitate the secure upload of source news articles, offer brainstorming templates, and guide the creation of the "Director's Notes" in a structured, machine-readable format. This structured input is crucial for ensuring clarity and interpretability for subsequent AI-assisted steps, as inconsistent or incomplete data at this initial stage could compromise the entire LLM-assisted workflow.  
* **The Baffling Broadcaster**: This persona contributes satirical narrative points and voiceover suggestions, embodying an "out-of-touch, self-important breakfast TV presenter with a cheerful and chatty demeanour". Their output is a "Voiceover Script Brief," which includes suggested lines for the introduction, main body, and outro of the segment. The platform must provide a dedicated interface that allows this persona to craft their unique, oblivious commentary, ensuring the tone is upbeat, chatty, and fundamentally unaware of its own insensitivity.  
* **The Satirical Screenwriter**: This role involves crafting short, impactful video scripts, typically ranging from 30 to 120 seconds, using black humour and cynical critique. The Screenwriter's output is a "Shot Brief" that contains all dialogue and narration for each individual shot. The platform must offer robust tools for scriptwriting, character development, and outline management, facilitating the creation of sharp dialogue and memorable characters.  
* **The Cinematic Storyboarder**: This expert translates the satirical script into detailed storyboards, focusing on cinematic techniques and adhering strictly to the technical constraints of AI video generation, specifically the 8-second maximum duration per shot. The Storyboarder adds visual details directly to the "Shot Brief," including camera angles, shot types, character blocking, lighting, and scene transitions. The platform must provide visual planning tools and a clear method for specifying these detailed visual elements. The 8-second constraint for AI video generation is a critical technical limitation, and the platform's storyboard interface must incorporate built-in validation and visual cues to prevent users from planning shots exceeding this duration. This proactive enforcement ensures that the creative planning is optimised for AI model capabilities from an early stage, thereby preventing costly rework later in the production process.  
* **The Soundscape Architect**: This persona develops detailed sound design notes for each storyboard shot, encompassing ambient Foley, specific sound effects (SFX), and broadcast audio elements. These sound notes are added directly to the unified "Shot Brief". The platform must provide a clear mechanism for specifying these detailed audio cues, ensuring they are precisely linked to specific visuals and contribute to a cohesive and tonally consistent auditory experience.  
* **The Video Prompt Engineer**: Operating at the final stage of the creative process, this highly specialised AI prompt engineer translates the completed 'Shot Brief' into precise, effective, and cohesive text prompts for AI video generation models, primarily Veo3. Their core function is to ensure visual and character continuity across all shots of a video. The platform must provide a mechanism to aggregate all components of the 'Shot Brief' (narrative, visual, and audio notes) into a single, structured prompt for each shot. The "unified 'Shot Brief'" is explicitly designated as the single source for the Video Prompt Engineer.\[1, 1, 1, 1\] This necessitates a robust backend data aggregation mechanism within the desktop application that consolidates narrative, visual, and audio notes for each shot into a single, coherent prompt structure. This is a crucial technical requirement for effective LLM optimisation, as it ensures that the AI receives a comprehensive and consistent input for video generation.

### **2.2 User Flows**

The SVPP is designed around sequential user flows, ensuring a logical progression from initial concept to final AI prompt generation. Each flow incorporates distinct stages of collaboration, review, and approval.

* **Project Initiation Flow**: The Project Director initiates a new project by uploading the source news article. The Creative Strategist then accesses this material to develop the "Director's Notes," outlining the central satirical hook, characters, and visual concepts. The Project Director reviews these notes and provides approval before the project can advance.  
* **Script Development Flow**: Upon approval of the Director's Notes, the Satirical Screenwriter accesses these foundational guidelines. They propose a brief outline of the video's setting, key characters, and narrative arc, which is then submitted to the Project Director for approval. Once approved, the Screenwriter drafts the full script, including dialogue and narration, integrating the "Voiceover Script Brief" provided by the Baffling Broadcaster.\[1, 1\] The Project Director conducts a final review and approves the completed script.  
* **Visual & Audio Design Flow**: With the approved script, the Cinematic Storyboarder designs a detailed storyboard, breaking the script into individual shots and adhering strictly to the 8-second AI generation rule for each panel. Concurrently, or subsequently, the Soundscape Architect adds detailed sound notes for ambient Foley, specific sound effects, and broadcast audio elements to each storyboard shot. The Project Director reviews and approves this combined "Shot Brief," which now contains both visual and audio specifications.  
* **AI Prompt Generation Flow**: The Video Prompt Engineer accesses the approved "Shot Brief." The system then automatically aggregates all relevant data for each shot—including dialogue, visual details, and sound notes—into a single, unified data object.\[1, 1, 1, 1\] The Prompt Engineer module then generates Veo3-optimised text prompts for each shot, ensuring consistency in character appearance and overall cinematic integrity. The Project Director reviews these generated prompts and initiates the AI video generation process.  
* **Collaboration & Feedback Loop**: Throughout all these flows, the platform will incorporate robust mechanisms for commenting, version control, and clear approval stages. This iterative refinement process ensures transparent communication and continuous improvement of the creative assets at each step.

### **2.3 Interface Considerations**

The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the SVPP will be designed to be intuitive and efficient for all personas.

* **Intuitive Dashboards**: Centralised dashboards will provide Project Directors with a clear overview of project status, assigned tasks, and pending actions, enabling efficient task management and oversight.  
* **Dedicated Workspaces**: Each persona will have a tailored workspace equipped with specific creative tools. For instance, the Satirical Screenwriter will have a rich text editor for scriptwriting, while the Cinematic Storyboarder will utilise a visual canvas for arranging and detailing storyboard panels.  
* **Clear Visual Indicators**: The interface will provide explicit visual cues for progress, pending actions, and critical technical constraints. This includes prominent warnings or visual indicators for shot lengths exceeding the 8-second AI generation limit within the storyboard module.  
* **Collaborative Features**: Integrated commenting and annotation features will be available on all shared documents, such as Director's Notes, scripts, and storyboards, fostering seamless feedback and iterative refinement among team members.

This may include shared notes, comment sections, and potentially idea generation tools to facilitate the deconstruction of news stories and identification of comedic opportunities.  
* **Director's Notes Editor**: A structured editor will enable the Creative Strategist to input the "News Article Summary," "Central Satirical Hook," "Characters & Perspectives," and "Visual Concepts & Locations". This editor will guide the user to ensure all required fields are completed and formatted correctly. The structured nature of these "Director's Notes" and subsequent outputs from other personas (e.g., Voiceover Script Brief, Shot Brief components) necessitates a robust, schema-driven data validation layer within the desktop application. This validation ensures that inputs from each persona are complete, correctly formatted, and semantically consistent, which is paramount for the downstream AI prompt generation by Veo3. Inconsistent or incomplete data at any stage would disrupt the LLM-assisted workflow, leading to errors or suboptimal AI outputs. Therefore, the input forms and editors for each persona's output must not merely be free text fields but must adhere to a predefined schema, ensuring data quality and usability for the AI model.  
* **Feedback & Approval Workflow**: A clear mechanism will allow the Project Director to review the drafted Director's Notes and provide explicit approval, signifying readiness to proceed to subsequent creative stages.

### **3.3 Scripting Module**

This module supports the development of the video script, integrating narrative and voiceover elements.

* **Script Outline Tool**: Functionality will be provided for the Satirical Screenwriter to propose and refine a narrative outline, specifying the video's setting, key characters, and overall arc, based on the approved Director's Notes. This outline will require Project Director approval before full scriptwriting commences.  
* **Script Editor**: A dedicated editor will enable the Satirical Screenwriter to write the script in a standard format (e.g., scene headings, character names, dialogue). This editor will be designed to facilitate the seamless integration of the Baffling Broadcaster's voiceover suggestions.  
* **Voiceover Integration**: A specific mechanism will allow for the incorporation of the "Voiceover Script Brief" directly into the script. This could manifest as a separate track, inline annotations, or a distinct section within the script editor, ensuring that the Baffling Broadcaster's unique, oblivious tone and commentary are maintained and correctly positioned within the narrative.  
* **Character Management**: A repository will be maintained for character descriptions, ensuring consistency in character appearance and behaviour across the script and, critically, in the subsequent visual prompts generated for the AI.

### **3.4 Storyboarding & Visual Design Module**

This module translates the script into a visual blueprint for the video.

* **Storyboard Canvas**: An interactive visual canvas will be provided for the Cinematic Storyboarder to create and arrange storyboard panels, representing individual shots of the video.  
* **Shot Detail Editor**: For each storyboard panel, a detailed editor will allow the Storyboarder to input specific visual parameters: a numbered panel identifier , the precise shot length (with a clear visual warning and validation mechanism to prevent exceeding 8 seconds, as this is a critical AI generation constraint) , the specific camera angle (e.g., close-up, wide shot) , the character's action and expression within the shot , and the desired lighting and mood. This editor will also allow linking to the relevant script dialogue or narration for that shot.  
* **Visual Style Selection**: A dropdown or selector will allow the Satirical Screenwriter or Cinematic Storyboarder to confirm the desired visual style for the video (e.g., photorealistic, cartoon, watercolour). This selection must propagate consistently to the final AI prompt to ensure visual coherence across the entire video.

* **Sound Library/Suggestions**: The platform may offer a curated library of common Foley sounds or broadcast stings, allowing for easy selection and consistent application across projects.

### **3.6 AI Prompt Generation & Management Module**

This is the central technical component, responsible for preparing inputs for the AI video generation.

* **Unified Shot Brief Aggregator**: This critical backend function will automatically compile all relevant data for each shot into a single, structured data object, referred to as the "Shot Brief".\[1, 1, 1\] This aggregation includes script dialogue, visual details from the Cinematic Storyboarder, and sound notes from the Soundscape Architect. The Video Prompt Engineer receives this completed 'Shot Brief' for each shot, and its primary task is to translate all this information into a single, well-structured text prompt for Veo3.  
* **Prompt Generation Engine**: An automated system will take the unified Shot Brief for each panel and construct the final, Veo3-optimised text prompt. This engine must strictly adhere to best practices for prompt structure, incorporating all necessary elements: shot type, subject, action, camera type, camera angle, lighting, mood, style, characters, dialogue/narration, and sound design notes. The system will explicitly state the intended AI model (e.g., "for Veo3") within the output.  
* **Character Consistency Management**: The system will enforce consistent naming conventions and detailed descriptions for characters across all prompts to ensure visual continuity and that characters appear the same across multiple shots generated by the AI. This may involve a character model library or persistent character identifiers.  
* **Prompt Review & Export**: The Project Director will have the ability to review the automatically generated prompts before final submission. The system will also allow for the export of these prompts for use with the Veo3 AI model.

### **3.7 Version Control & History**

To support collaborative and iterative development, the platform will include robust versioning.

## **4\. Technical Architecture & Stack**

This section outlines the proposed technical components, frameworks, and infrastructure for the SVPP. A strong emphasis is placed on considerations that facilitate LLM-assisted code generation and ensure the platform's robustness and local performance.

### **4.1 High-Level Architecture**

The SVPP will be developed as a standalone desktop application, leveraging frameworks suitable for rich client-side experiences and local resource management.

* **Application Framework**: A cross-platform desktop application framework such as Electron (for web technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Qt (for C++), or a native framework like WPF (.NET for Windows) or Swift/Cocoa (for macOS) will be used. Electron is a strong candidate given the existing web-centric UI descriptions (chat interface, document views).  
* **Backend Logic (Embedded)**: Unlike a web application with a separate server, the core business logic, workflow orchestration, and data processing will be embedded directly within the desktop application. This means the application will handle all data manipulation, persona interactions, and API calls locally.  
* **Local Database**: An embedded relational database, such as SQLite, will be used for structured data storage. This includes project metadata, user roles, and the highly structured creative outputs like Director's Notes, Shot Brief components, and generated prompts. This choice supports offline functionality and simplifies deployment.  
* **Local File Storage**: The application will directly interact with the user's local file system for storing uploaded news articles, generated video outputs, and any other large media assets. This aligns with the user's preference to avoid large online file storage.

### **4.2 LLM-Optimised Development Considerations**

The architecture will be specifically designed to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-assisted code generation.

* **Modular Design**: The system's architecture will be highly modular, with a clear separation of concerns for each functional area (e.g., Project Management, Creative Strategy, Scripting, Storyboarding, Sound Design, AI Prompt Generation). This modularity significantly facilitates LLM-assisted code generation by allowing LLMs to focus on discrete, well-defined components, reducing complexity and improving accuracy.  
* **Internal API/Service Layer**: Even within a monolithic desktop application, an internal API or service layer will be defined. This provides clear interfaces between different modules, enabling LLMs to generate code for inter-module communication more effectively.  
* **Schema Definition**: Strict data schemas, preferably using formal definitions like JSON Schema, will be applied to all structured inputs and outputs (e.g., Director's Notes, Shot Brief components, final prompts). This provides explicit and unambiguous guidance for LLMs on the expected data structures and validation rules, which is essential for generating correct and robust data handling code.  
* **Code Generation Patterns**: Adherence to common design patterns, architectural principles, and established coding conventions will be prioritised. This ensures that the LLM-generated code is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and consistent with best practices, reducing the effort required for human review and refinement.

### **4.3 Performance & Resource Management**

The desktop application will be engineered for optimal performance on local machines.

* **Efficient Resource Usage**: The application will be designed to minimise CPU, memory, and disk usage, ensuring a smooth experience even on moderately configured machines.  
* **Multi-threading/Asynchronous Operations**: Where appropriate, multi-threading or asynchronous programming will be employed to prevent the UI from freezing during long-running operations, such as AI prompt generation or large file processing.  
* **Local Data Optimisation**: Database queries and file system operations will be optimised for speed, leveraging indexing and efficient data access patterns.

### **4.4 Security**

Security will be a fundamental consideration throughout the design and development process, with a focus on local data protection and secure external communication.

* **Local Data Encryption**: Sensitive project data stored locally (e.g., in the SQLite database or specific project files) will be encrypted at rest to protect against unauthorised access to the user's local machine.  
* **Secure API Key Storage**: API keys for external services (e.g., Veo3, other AI models) will be stored securely within the application, using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager) where possible, and never hardcoded.  
* **Network Communication Security**: All communication with external APIs (e.g., AI video generation services) will use secure protocols (HTTPS) to protect data in transit.  
* **Input Validation**: Strict validation and sanitisation of all user inputs will be performed to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## **5\. Data Model & Requirements**

This section defines the core data entities, their relationships, and the requirements for data storage and flow within the SVPP. A clear and well-defined data model is essential for both human understanding of the system's structure and for accurate LLM code generation, particularly for database schema and API definitions.

### **5.1 Core Data Entities**

The following entities represent the fundamental building blocks of the SVPP's information architecture:

* **User**: Represents an individual user of the platform. Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), Name, Email, and Role (e.g., Project Director, Creative Strategist, Satirical Screenwriter, Cinematic Storyboarder, Soundscape Architect, Video Prompt Engineer).

Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), ProjectID (Foreign Key to Project ID), DirectorNotesID (Foreign Key to DirectorNotes ID), Outline (structured text or JSON for the narrative arc), Content (the full script text, potentially in a structured format), Status, and Version.  
* **Shot**: Represents an individual visual and auditory segment of the video. Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), ScriptID (Foreign Key to Script ID), PanelNumber, LengthSeconds (with validation for \<= 8 seconds), CameraAngle, CharacterAction, LightingMood, Dialogue/Narration (text for that specific shot), and VisualStyle (e.g., photorealistic, cartoon, watercolour).  
* **SoundNotes**: Stores the sound design details for a specific shot. Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), ShotID (Foreign Key to Shot ID), AmbientFoley, SpecificSFX, and BroadcastAudio.  
* **Prompt**: Stores the AI-optimised text prompt generated for a specific shot. Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), ShotID (Foreign Key to Shot ID), GeneratedPromptText, AIModel (e.g., Veo3), and GeneratedVideoURL (link to the output video from the AI service).  
* **Comment**: Facilitates collaboration and feedback. Attributes include: ID (Primary Key), TargetEntityID (Foreign Key to any relevant entity, e.g., ScriptID, ShotID), CommentText, Author (Foreign Key to User ID), and Timestamp.

### **5.2 Relationships**

The relationships between these entities define how data is connected and accessed within the system:

* **One-to-many**:  
  * Project to NewsArticle (One project can have multiple news articles as source material).  
  * Project to DirectorNotes (One project has one set of Director's Notes).  
  * DirectorNotes to Script (One set of Director's Notes leads to one script).  
  * Script to Shot (One script comprises multiple shots).  
  * Shot to SoundNotes (One shot has one set of sound notes).  
  * Shot to Prompt (One shot generates one AI prompt).  
* **Many-to-many**:  
  * Project to User (via AssignedPersonas): A project can have multiple users assigned to it, and a user can be assigned to multiple projects.

### **5.3 Data Flow**

Data within the SVPP will flow sequentially through the creative pipeline, with each persona's input progressively enriching a central data structure, culminating in the 'Shot Brief' that feeds the AI prompt generation.  
The flow begins with a News Article being ingested. This informs the Director's Notes, which then guide the Script development. The script, in turn, is broken down into individual Shots. Each Shot is then augmented with Visuals from the Cinematic Storyboarder and Sound details from the Soundscape Architect. All these components for each shot are then consolidated into a Unified Shot Brief. Finally, this comprehensive Unified Shot Brief is used to generate the AI Prompt for the video generation service. This structured, sequential flow ensures data integrity and traceability throughout the production process.

### **5.4 Key Table: Data Entity Relationship Model**

A clear Entity-Relationship (ER) model is foundational for any web application. For LLM-assisted development, this table is exceptionally valuable because it provides a precise blueprint for database schema generation, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) definitions, and API design. LLMs can directly translate these relationships and attributes into database tables, models, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage. Without this explicit model, LLMs would struggle with consistency and correctness in data-related code, leading to significant development challenges.

## **6\. Integrations & APIs**

This section specifies the external systems, services, or APIs that the SVPP will need to interact with to fulfil its core functionality. These integrations are critical for the platform's ability to generate AI videos and manage content.

### **6.1 AI Video Generation Service (Veo3)**

* **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this integration is to send the meticulously prepared AI prompts to the chosen video generation service, Veo3, and subsequently receive the generated video outputs. This is the core external dependency for the platform's value proposition.  
* **Integration Type**: The integration will primarily rely on a RESTful API. This involves making HTTP requests to submit prompts and retrieve results.  
* **Requirements**: The system will need to handle RESTful API calls for prompt submission, including any necessary authentication (e.g., API keys). Given that video generation can be time-consuming, the integration must support asynchronous callbacks or polling mechanisms to efficiently track video generation status and retrieve the final video URLs once processing is complete. The explicit mention of "Veo3" indicates a specific API integration requirement. The PRD must detail the interaction model, including authentication protocols, data formats for sending prompts, and the method for receiving generated video URLs. This level of technical specificity is crucial for LLMs to generate accurate and functional API client code, ensuring seamless communication with the external AI service.

### **6.2 News Article Source (Potential)**

* **Purpose**: To provide an option for automatically fetching news articles, complementing manual uploads. This could streamline the initial content ingestion process.  
* **Integration Type**: This could involve parsing RSS feeds from news sources, implementing web scraping functionalities for specific news websites, or integrating with a commercial news API.  
* **Requirements**: Any such integration would require secure access protocols, adherence to rate limiting policies imposed by external services, and robust error handling to manage connectivity issues or changes in external data formats.

### **6.3 User Authentication (Potential)**

* **Purpose**: To enable single sign-on (SSO) or integrate with existing organisational identity providers, simplifying user management and access.  
* **Integration Type**: Standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0 or SAML would be considered for secure and interoperable authentication.

### **6.4 Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)**

* **Purpose**: To serve as the scalable and durable repository for uploaded news articles, the final generated video files, and any other large media assets produced or consumed by the platform. While the primary storage is local, cloud storage could be an optional backup or sharing mechanism.  
* **Integration Type**: Integration would typically be achieved through the use of official Software Development Kits (SDKs) provided by the cloud providers or direct API calls to their storage services.
